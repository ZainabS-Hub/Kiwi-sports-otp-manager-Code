Summary: Meeting Client Requirements
The OTP Manager successfully addresses Kiwi Sports Apparel's login security needs by implementing multi-factor authentication through one-time passcodes. The solution provides:
Core Functionality: Accepts integer passcodes with configurable durations (default 5 minutes), automatically invalidating expired codes to prevent unauthorized access.
Key Features: Returns boolean values indicating passcode existence status, overwrites durations for existing passcodes, and ensures time-based access control through timestamp validation.
Security Enhancement: Creates key-value pairs storing passcodes with expiration times, adding a critical authentication layer that protects user data from unauthorized access while maintaining usability through configurable durations and automatic cleanup mechanisms.
